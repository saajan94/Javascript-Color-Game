The Great RGB Color Game is an application that uses vanilla Javascript to give the user a random combination of 3 numbers and they have to guess the color by selecting it. There are 2 modes (easy gives the user 3 options and hard gives them 6 options).

### How It Works
* Initially, the user selects Easy or Hard mode.
* The user then starts guessing my clicking a box containing a color.
* Once the right color is selected, the user has the option to play again.

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
